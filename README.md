# Google-Coding-Challenge (Youtube simulation)
A coding challenge given during Bright Network Summer internship experience program.

## Installing Python and pytest
Please make sure you install Python 3.7 or higher.

The tests are using `pytest`, if you don't have `pytest` installed yet, you can do so by running:
```shell script
python3 -m pip install pytest
```
pip should be installed already if you installed Python from the official source. If not, you
can find many guides online on how to install pip for your operating system.

## Running and testing from the Commandline
To run the command-line application:
```shell script
python3 -m src.run
```
You can close the app by typing `EXIT` as a command.

#### Running the tests
To run all the tests:
```shell script
python3 -m pytest
```
For more verbose test output you can use
```shell script
python3 -m pytest -v
```
